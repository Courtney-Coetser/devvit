# Getting started with Devvit

Your project has been created using a Devvit template. Follow the steps below to get started with the app tutorial.
Next up is uploading and developing your app using playtest.

## Step One - Upload: In the project directory, run:

### `devvit upload`

Upload the app to the App Directory. Uploaded apps are only visible to you (the app owner) and can only be installed to a small test subreddit with less than 200 subscribers.

## Step Two - Playtest: In the project directory, run:

### `devvit playtest <subreddit-name>`

Installs your app to your test subreddit and starts a playtest session. A new version is installed whenever you save changes to your app code, and logs are continuously streamed. Just refresh to see your changes!

## Step Three - Update

From here, the tutorial should carry you through updating the app! Make sure you are saving each change while playtesting before refreshing your test post.
