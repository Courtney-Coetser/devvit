# Building Community Games on Devvit

Reddit offers a unique platform for a new category of social games. This guide will help you create engaging community games that thrive in Reddit's ecosystem with lessons from some of the games we've seen so far.

## What Are Community Games?

Community games are asynchronous multiplayer experiences built specifically for Reddit's platform. They leverage Reddit's unique social dynamics and content mechanics to create engaging, bite-sized gaming experiences that scale from single players to thousands.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Keep It Bite-Sized

- Focus on quick, discrete gameplay loops
- Reduce "time to fun" - players should be having fun within seconds
- Small scope = faster development and easier maintenance
- Example: [r/ChezzQuiz](https://reddit.com/r/chessquizz) offers daily chess puzzles rather than full matches

### 2. Design for the Feed

- Create an eye-catching first screen that stands out
- Include a clear, immediate call to action
- Remember: You're competing with cat videos and memes
- Example: [r/Pixelary](https://reddit.com/r/pixelary]) shows the drawing canvas right in the feed

### 3. Build Content Flywheels

Reddit posts naturally decay after a few days. Your game needs a strategy to stay relevant:

**Option A: Scheduled Content**

- Daily/weekly challenges
- Automated post creation
- Regular tournaments or events
- Example: [r/Sections](https://reddit.com/r/sections) posts a new puzzle every day

**Option B: Player-Generated Content**

- Players create content through gameplay
- Each play creates new posts/comments
- Moderation systems for quality control
- Example: [r/CaptionContest](https://reddit.com/r/captioncontest) turns each submission into new content

### 4. Embrace Asynchronous Play

Benefits:

- Players can participate anytime
- Lower commitment (one move vs. entire game)
- Larger player pool across time zones
- Better scalability

### 5. Scale From One to Many

Your game should be fun at any player count:

- Single-player baseline experience
- Scales smoothly as more players join
- Uses leaderboards to create competition
- Example: [r/DarkDungeonGame](https://reddit.com/r/darkdungeongame) works solo but gets better with more players solving together

## Successful Examples Breakdown

### Pixelary (Drawing & Guessing Game)

- **Primary Loop**: Draw (hard) → Creates posts
- **Secondary Loop**: Guess (easy) → Creates comments (optionally)
- **Why It Works**:
  - Clear mental model
  - Two-tiered engagement
  - Natural content generation
  - Scales with community size

### ChezzQuiz (Competitive Chess Puzzles)

- **Core Loop**: Daily puzzles with competitive solving
