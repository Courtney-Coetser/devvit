# Quickstart

:::note
This quickstart is _really_ quick. For step-by-step instructions, see the [**building an app guide**](dev_guide).
:::

Here's the tl;dr for building on the Developer Platform. Apps are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Before
you get started, you'll need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.2.0+)

    You’re going to work with TypeScript. In order for Typescript to work with Devvit, you’ll need a working Node.js environment and then the Devvit command line interface. Node.js is an open-source server environment that makes it possible to develop and run Javascript apps anywhere. Node.js lets you import and use packages (code that other people have written) into your code.

**Option 1: Use node version manager (nvm)**

Install or update [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to use as a handy command-line tool for managing multiple Node.js versions on your system. This will allow you to switch between different versions easily. If you to use a different node version manager, check out these [suggestions from npmjs.org](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

For macOS or Linux:

1. Run the following command line in your terminal to install nvm.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.6/install.sh | bash
```

2. Close and re-open your terminal to have nvm available.

3. Install the latest version of Node.js.

```bash
nvm install node
```

For Windows:

1. Download and install nvm-windows by following the instructions in the [repository](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

2. Restart your terminal or command prompt.

3. Install the latest version of Node.js.

```bash
nvm install node
```

**Option 2: Use Node.js installer from nodejs.org**

1. Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org) to download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and npm (the package manager for Node.js).

:::note
If you install Node.js this way, you may experience permissions issues when trying to run Devvit, which is [documented on NPM's website](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Additionally, when Node updates in the future, you'll need to uninstall and reinstall Node to get the latest version working. Both NPM and us here at Reddit highly encourage you to use nvm if possible. If that's not possible, here are some tips on how to [fix these permissions issues](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). For Windows users specifically, please use a node version manager.
:::

Check that Node.js is installed correctly by running the following commands:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see the version numbers for Node.js and npm as output.

- a [test subreddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001766991-How-to-create-a-subreddit) that you moderate with
  less than 200 members
- a code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

Run the following commands to install the Devvit CLI, and then create, upload, and
preview your app. You can also follow along with the video (the tutorial starts at 1:35).

```bash
npm install -g devvit
devvit login
devvit new --template experience-post
cd my-project
devvit upload
devvit playtest <my-subreddit>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn global add devvit

```bash
pnpm install -g devvit
devvit login
devvit new --template experience-post
cd my-project
devvit upload
devvit playtest <my-subreddit>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Visit your subreddit and interact with your app. As you make and save code modifications, playtest will automatically build and deploy the app to your subreddit. Simply refresh the page to view the latest changes.

While the playtest is active, you will be streaming logs from the app. This is useful for debugging and gaining insights into how your app is running.

To stop the playtest, press `Ctrl + c`.

:::note
Reddit collects usage metrics when you use the Devvit CLI. For more information, see
[Reddit’s Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms) and the
[Reddit Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy). You can opt out at any time by
using the `devvit metrics off` command.

## Next steps

Now you know how to create and deploy apps! Next up, try the following:

- Check out the [showcase](/docs/showcase/apps.mdx) to see what others have created.
- Learn how to [publish](dev_guide/#9-publish) your app and make it public in the Apps directory.
- Follow the [Remind Me](/docs/showcase/tutorials/remind_me.md) tutorial.
