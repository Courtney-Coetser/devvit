### Remind me

Learn how to implement a Remind Me Later feature on Reddit using scheduler and the Reddit API client. The tutorial covers creating scheduled jobs, displaying custom input forms, and leveraging the chrono-node library to interpret user-inputted timeframes like "in two weeks." Users can set reminders from the overflow menu of a post, and the Remind Me app automatically sends private messages containing post links at the scheduled times, enhancing user engagement.

**Capabilities used:**

- [Menu actions](../menu_actions)
- [Forms](../forms)
- [Scheduler](../scheduler)

### Three strikes

In this tutorial, you'll learn to implement a powerful moderation tool using Redis and the Reddit API, creating a "Three Strikes" system to manage rule violations within a community. The tutorial guides you through setting up the app, adding menu actions, and creating mod functionalities. The "Three Strikes" system imposes escalating penalties: a warning message for the first strike, a one-day community ban for the second, and a one-year ban for the third. The tutorial covers creating keys for authors using Redis, fetching posts and comments, checking and removing strikes, and even banning users when necessary. With step-by-step instructions and code snippets, you'll build a robust moderation tool that enhances community management on Reddit.

**Capabilities used:**

- [Menu actions](../menu_actions)
- [Forms](../forms)
- [Redis](../redis)
